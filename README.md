How to play this game.
Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player strategy game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking the spaces in the grid with either an "X" or an "O". The objective is to be the first player to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If all nine spaces are filled without a winning combination, the game ends in a draw. The game encourages logical thinking, foresight, and planning, making it a popular choice for beginners and casual gaming.
